# Project Real State #1

JavaScript is a very popular and versatile programming language that is widely used in web development. It supports a wide range of platforms and devices, and is a good choice for projects involving data manipulation and user interaction.

This project was developed in 3 and a half hours, thanks to a tutorial on YouTube, content creator and FullStack programmer, JavaScript Mastery thanks to him I was able to make this great project called Real State, I hope it will be useful for future projects, or so you can improve your knowledge of this project!

Have I encountered any particular challenges while working on this project? What have I learned or improved in my programming skills through this project?

Thanks to [@JavaScriptMastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) I have developed better my ability to understand how everything is connected, how to integrate different libraries, like "CHAKRA, FRAMER MOTION, MILLIFY, NPROGRESS & REACT HORIZONTAL SCROLLING MENU".

Besides that he explains in an incredible way, I love to see his videos and explanations, creation of Apps, Clones etc...
